## DESIGN TOOLS

### VERSION CONTROL: ABSTRACT 

Abstract is a version control tool for design files. Currently it only supports Sketch but support for other tools are in development. We use abstract for two main reasons: to have every project easily accessible to the entire team, and be able to access files from any point in time. We use this tool hand in tandem with Sketch.

Abstract tracks changes to Sketch files so you can reference or revert back to previous files. It also allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting their changes. Always launch Sketch from Abstract to ensure that the changes are being captured.

### DESIGN: SKETCH

For user interface design and wireframing we favor Sketch. Sketch has strong support for vector based designs and integration with tools for graphic production and prototyping. When needed we may also leverage Adobe Creative Cloud tools.

Consider these general practices when designing user interfaces using Sketch.

- Use vector drawing tools only to enable scaling to different screen resolutions - avoid raster based tools
- Leverage symbols (or smart objects in Photoshop) for reusable assets like buttons, switches, etc.
- Design in 1x scale - avoids accidentally creating half pixel sizes when scaling designs
- Snap to pixel grid
- Keep layers and layer groups well organized and use meaningful names

### DEVELOPER HANDOFF: ZEPLIN 

Zeplin is used for developer handoff from the designer. Zeplin works with Sketch and Adobe XD. It provides design specs for the developer including exact colors, dimensions and positioning. Zeplin can also be used to create a style guide for the project.

### ADOBE CREATIVE CLOUD

We do still use Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects, XD, and InDesign as needed.
