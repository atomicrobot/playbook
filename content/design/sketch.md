### ASSET EXPORTING

Make sure that you are designing in 1x. Be aware of the artboard background. You can leave this option unchecked for a transparent background, or turn this on to include a background color in the export. The color can be manipulated.

To simplify the workflow of asset production we use the export feature of Sketch. This becomes even more valuable as we iterate on a design. These tools allow the assets to be generated, scaled and named appropriately for each device and resolution required.

GLYPHS

Consider these general guidelines when creating glyphs and icons. 
Use the vector based drawing tools in Sketch or Adobe Creative Cloud (Illustrator, XD, Photoshop)
Use artboards or slices to specify exact sizing and for visually centering glyphs/icons
Use a consistent style of line weight, corner radius and fill for icons to maintain a coherent design
Export the artboards or slices for glyphs and icons as vector files

IOS: 1x PDF
ANDROID: 1x SVG

PHOTOGRAPHY

When using stock photography it is important to ensure the photography is license appropriately. When using photography in an app, export the images as JPG for best comparison and quality

### INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPES

SKETCH

Sketch can be used for creating basic, interactive prototypes. However, it currently is fairly limited. Flinto or After Effects can be used for more advanced prototypes and animations.

### SKETCH BEST PRACTICES

SKETCH LIBRARIES

Sketch supports shared Libraries for common assets used across multiple projects. We store our Sketch libraries in Abstract.

RESIZING CONSTRAINTS

Use resizing constraints in Sketch to make designs adaptive.

ARTBOARDS

Use artboards with meaningful names to group layers.

LAYER STYLES

Use layer styles to reuse stylistic elements throughout the Sketch document,. 

https://sketchapp.com/docs/styling/shared-styles/

TEXT STYLES

Define text styles to for text elements used throughout the document.

SYMBOLS

Define symbols for design elements used throughout the document. Convert the symbols to libraries for reuse across documents.
