# Swift

All new iOS projects at Atomic Robot use the latest production version of Swift. Swift is Apple's preferred programming language due to its safety and productivity features. iOS developers at Atomic Robot must also be well versed in Objective-C for interopperability with existing frameworks and support of legacy projects.

See our [iOS Style Guide](style-guide)

# Standard Dependencies

The following are common libraries and command line tools that we utilize on iOS projects. We try to keep our dependency on third-party libraries to a minimum. 

## [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

Dependency management with support for Swift Frameworks and Objective C

## [R.swift](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift)

Runtime type safety for resources like strings, images, fonts and segues

## [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)

Supplemental static analysis

## [Fabric](https://fabric.io/kits/ios/) 

If an app crashes, we want to be the first to know - whether in development or production

## [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools)

Build automation
